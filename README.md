- Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
- For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

- Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.
- For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].
